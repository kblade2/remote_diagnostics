This repository contains Google Sheet ID for individual 00x_EVD_ESP_RD Boards respectively.

Upon every power up condition, the respective links are fetched by the respective 00x_EVD_ESP_RD Boards to identify which Google sheet they have to send data to.

These links can be updated each time to change the Google Sheet Location in which we want out data to be logged.

NOTE: Github takes time of 5-10 mins to reflect the updated changes. Thus changes should be done 10 mins before power up of ESP board.
